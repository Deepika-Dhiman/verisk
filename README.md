Project: Threshold and Limit Processor

**Overview**
This project reads numerical input values from stdin and processes them based on a given threshold and limit.

**Usage**

Compilation:
To compile the project, use the following command:
./compile

Execution:
The program expects input from stdin and two arguments: the threshold and the limit. Execute it using:

cat input | ./compute threshold limit

input: A file containing numerical inputs, one value per line.

threshold: A floating-point number specifying the threshold to adjust input values.

limit: A floating-point number specifying the upper limit for the cumulative sum.
